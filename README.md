# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Python based Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
I used Tkinter module to provide a simple GUI window. 
This can be played by two players under the 'Multiple player' option and by one player under the 'Single player' option where the player plays with the AI that uses minimax algorithm to defeat the player.
